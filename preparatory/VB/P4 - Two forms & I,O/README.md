# P4 - Two Forms and Input/Output

This is a sample project demonstrating the use of two forms in a Windows Forms Application and input/output operations.

The main form (Form1) contains two buttons (Button1 and Button2) and a text box (TextBox1). Clicking on Button1 stores the value entered in TextBox1 in the x variable. Clicking on Button2 adds the value entered in TextBox1 to x, displays the new value in TextBox1, and opens a second form (Form2) displaying the same value.

Form2 contains a text box (TextBox1) and a label (Label1). When opened, it displays the value stored in x from Form1.

This project is created for educational purposes only and may be used as a starting point for developing similar applications.
