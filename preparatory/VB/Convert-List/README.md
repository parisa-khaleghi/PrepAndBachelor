# CheckedListBox to ListBox Converter

This VB.NET program allows you to convert selected items in a CheckedListBox to a ListBox by clicking a button.

# How it works

Upon loading the Form1, the program populates the CheckedListBox with the numbers 0 through 10. When the user clicks the "Convert" button, the program iterates through each item in the CheckedListBox and checks if it is selected. If an item is selected, the program adds that item to the ListBox.
