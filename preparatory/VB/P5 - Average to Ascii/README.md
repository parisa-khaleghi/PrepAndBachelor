# Average to Ascii

This project is a simple Windows Forms application written in Visual Basic that demonstrates the use of dynamic arrays and basic arithmetic operations.

# Description

The application allows the user to input a series of numbers into a TextBox and displays the count, sum, and average of all entered numbers in a Label. The application dynamically creates an array of short integers to store the input values and uses the ReDim Preserve keyword to resize the array as needed.

The application also includes input validation to ensure that only numeric input is accepted in the TextBox. This is accomplished by handling the TextBox.KeyPress event and filtering out any non-numeric input.

# Getting Started
