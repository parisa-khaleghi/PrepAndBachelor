# TextBox Copy-Paste Project

This VB.NET project allows you to copy text from one TextBox and paste it into another by clicking a button.

# How it Works

When the form loads, the program automatically selects all text in the first TextBox. When the user clicks the "Copy" button, the program copies the selected text to the clipboard. When the user clicks the "Paste" button, the program pastes the copied text into the second TextBox.
