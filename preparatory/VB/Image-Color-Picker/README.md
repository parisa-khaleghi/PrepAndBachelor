# Image Color Picker Project

This VB.NET project allows you to pick the color of any pixel in an image by moving the mouse over the image. The RGB values of the pixel are displayed in labels on the form.

# How it Works

When the form loads, the program displays an image in a PictureBox control. When the user moves the mouse over the image, the program gets the color of the pixel under the mouse cursor and displays the RGB values of the pixel in labels on the form.

The program also includes menu items to open and reset images, and to exit the program.
