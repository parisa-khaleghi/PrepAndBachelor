# Magic Square Generator using Ulam Spiral Algorithm in VB.NET

This project implements a Magic Square Generator in VB.NET using the Ulam Spiral Algorithm. A Magic Square is a square matrix of numbers, where the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same.

# Installation

To run this project, you will need Visual Studio with the VB.NET language installed. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

# Usage

Open the project in Visual Studio and run the code. Enter the size of the Magic Square you want to generate in the text box and click the "Generate Magic Square" button. The program will use the Ulam Spiral Algorithm to fill the square matrix with numbers and check if it is a Magic Square. If it is a Magic Square, it will display the matrix in a message box.

Note: The algorithm works best for odd-sized Magic Squares. For even-sized Magic Squares, the algorithm may not generate a proper Magic Square.
