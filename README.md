# PrepAndBachelor

This repository contains multiple projects developed as part of my university program. The projects include both the preparatory and bachelor phases, and cover a range of topics and technologies.

# Getting Started

To get started with the projects, you need to clone the repository and setting up the development environment. Once you have the projects set up, you can explore the different directories to find the projects that interest you.

# Cloning the Repository

To get started with the projects in this repository, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine:

<ol>
  <li>Click on the green "Code" button in the GitHub repository and copy the HTTPS URL provided.</li>
  <li>Open your terminal or command prompt.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.</li>
  <li>Run the following command:<br/>
    <code>git clone {repository-URL} </code><br/>
    Replace {repository-URL} with the URL you copied in step 1.</li>
</ol>

# Setting up the Development Environment

Once you've cloned the repository, you'll need to set up your development environment. The specific steps will depend on the projects you want to work on, but here are some general guidelines:<br/>
<ol>
  <li>Install any required dependencies. Check the README files for each project to see what dependencies are needed.</li>
  <li>Set up any required configuration. Again, check the README files for each project to see what configuration is needed.</li>
  <li>Build the project. Some projects may require you to build the code before you can run it. Check the README files for each project to see what build steps are needed.</li>
  <li>Run the project. Once you've set up your development environment, you should be able to run the project. Check the README files for each project to see how to run it.</li>
</ol>
That's it! You should now be able to start working on the projects in this repository. If you run into any issues, check the project-specific README files for troubleshooting tips, or reach out to the project maintainers for help.

# Project Structure

The projects are organized into several directories:
<ul>
  <li>
<b>preparatory:</b> Contains the projects developed during the preparatory phase of the program. These projects cover fundamental topics and technologies, and are designed to help students build a solid foundation for further studies. 
  </li>
  <li>
<b>bachelor:</b> Contains the projects developed during the bachelor phase of the program. These projects cover advanced topics and technologies, and are designed to help students apply their knowledge and skills to real-world problems.
Each project directory contains its own README file, which provides more information about the project and how to run it. Some projects may also include documentation, datasets, or other resources.
  </li>
</ul>
